                                As name suggests this software is used to monitor the inspection level of each mechanical part
                                at its tracking phase. This software provides specification of each mechanical part allowing user
                                to verify the execution process along with status. If needed user can modify status and
                                specification with respect to requirements. It identifies overall process outcomes and helps in
                                collecting the actual results of each and every part with the help of charts and reading provided
                                by that process.
