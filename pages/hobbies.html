                            &emsp;&emsp;Coding gives me happiness.  When I solve something and it is being used in production, 
                            that is my top-most satisfaction. 
                            I have been coding for the last 5 years, and I love solving problems. <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;I have worked on different technologies and programming languages.

                            &emsp;&emsp;Traveling is an escape for me from my daily routine. I love being in nature. 
                            Being with nature makes me feel at peace and refreshed for my future.<br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;I dont miss the chance of traveling whenever its on its way.

                            &emsp;&emsp;There are so many people arround the world who are in need. I feel that its my responsibility to help
                            them to live a better life.<br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;I love to see the happiness on their faces when I help them. I am an active member of an NGO(Right Track Foundation) in India, 
                            and I take some time off to work with my best friend at the NGO.

                        <p>
                            &emsp;&emsp;Cupping therapy is a form of alternative medicine in which a local suction is created on the skin with the application of heated cups.<br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;I think its a good way to keep ourself healthy and free from illness, so I learned this technique to help my friends and family.
